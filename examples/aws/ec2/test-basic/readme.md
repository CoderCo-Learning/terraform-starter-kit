# EC2 Test Example

This example exists solely to support **Terratest** for the EC2 module.

It is intentionally minimal and is used by automated tests to validate that
the EC2 module can be successfully applied and destroyed.

This example is **not intended for direct consumption** and may change as
tests evolve.
